*UPDATE*
myHadoop is no longer being updated here. Originally written by Sriram Krishnan at SDSC, it is currently being maintained at https://github.com/glennklockwood/myhadoop/ 

myHadoop
--------
myHadoop is a simple system for end-users to provision Hadoop instances on traditional supercomputing resources, without requiring any root privileges. Users may use myHadoop to configure and instantiate Hadoop on the fly via regular batch scripts.
We are currently supporting the PBS (Moab) and the Sun Grid Engine (SGE) schedulers, although a port to a scheduler such as Condor would be very trivial.

The pbs-example.sh and sge-example.sh provide an example of how to use myHadoop with PBS and SGE respectively. For more details, please read the documentation in the "docs" directory.

Pre-requisites
--------------
myHadoop needs Apache Hadoop 0.20.2 and a batch scheduler such as PBS.
