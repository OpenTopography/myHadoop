myHadoop
--------

myHadoop enables the use of Hadoop in a non-dedicated cluster environment,
being administered by typical batch scheduler. We are currently supporting
the PBS (Moab) and the Sun Grid Engine (SGE) schedulers, although a port to
a scheduler such as Condor would be very trivial.

The pbs-example.sh and sge-example.sh provide an example of how to use
myHadoop with PBS and SGE respectively. For more details, please read the
documentation in the "docs" directory.


Pre-requisites
--------------
myHadoop needs Apache Hadoop 0.20.2 and a batch scheduler such as PBS.
